==========Lesson 1 A puma at large==================
Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America. When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously.However, as the evidence began to accumulate, exoerts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for teh descriptions given by people who cliamed to have seen the puma wrer extraordinarily similar.

The hunt for puma began in a small village where a women picking blackberries saw 'a large xat' only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it and the experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is concerned. The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one palce in the morning and at another place twnety miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left brhind it a trial of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Several people complained of 'cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for saveral weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quirt countryside.

=====================Lesson 2 Thirteen euqals one========================
Ouy vicar is always raising money fir one cause or another, but he has never managed to get enough money to have the vhurch clock repaired. The big clock wihch used to strike the hours day and night was damaged many yeara ago and has been silent ever since. 

One night, however, our vicar woke up with a start: the clock was striking the hours! Looking at this church, he saw it was one o'clock, but the bell strike thirteen times before it stopped. Armed with a torch, the vicar went up into the clock to see what is goinh on. Inthe torchlight, he caught sight of a figure whom he immediately recognized as Bill Wilkins, our local grocer.

'Whatever are you doing up here Bill?' asked the vicar in surprise.

'I'm trying to repair the bell,' answered Bill.'I've been coming up here night after night for weeks now. You see, I was hoping to give you a surprise.'

'You certainly did give me a surprise!' said the vicar. 'YOu've probanly woken up everyone in thet village as well. Still, I'm glad the bell is working again.'

'That'a the troubel,vicar,' answered Bill. 'It's working all right, but I'm afraid that at one o'clock it will strike thirtenn times and there's nothing I can do about it.'

'We'll get used to that, Bill, 'said the vicar. 'Thirteen is not as good s one, but it's better than nothing. Now let's go downstairs and have a cup of tea.'

========================Lesson 3 An unkown goddess=======================
Some times ago, an interesting discovery was made by archaeologists on the Aegean island of Kea. An Amerian team explored a temple which stands in an ancient city on the promontory of Ayia Irini. The city at one time must have been prosperous, for it enjoyed a high level of civilization. Houses -- often three storeys high -- were bulit of stone. They had large rooms with beautifully decorated walls.The city was even equipped with a drainage system, for a great many clay pipes were found beneath the narrow streets. 

The temple which is the archaeologists explored was used as a place of worship from the fifteenth century B.C. until Roman times. In the most sacred room of the temple, clay fragments of fifteen stastues were found. Each of these represented a goddess and had, at one time, been painted.The body of one statue was found among remains dating from the fifteenth century B.C. Its missing head happened to be among remains of the fifth century B.C. This head must have been fuond in Classical times and carefully preserved. It was very old and precious even then.When the archaelogist reconstructed the fragments, they were amazed to find that the goddess turned out to be a very modern-looking woman. She stood three feet high and her hands rested on her hips. She was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground. Despite her age, she was very graceful indeed, but, so far, the archeologistd have been unable to discover her identity.

=====================Lesson 4 The double life of Alfred Bloggs===================
These days, peopple who do manual work often receive far more money than people who work in offices. People who work in offices are frequently referred to as 'white-collar workers ' ofr the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work. Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers. This can give rise to the curious situations, as it did in the case of ALfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation. 

When he got married, Alf was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job. He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation. Every morning, he left home dressed in a smart black suit. He then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman. Before returning home at night, he took a shower and changed back into the suit. Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret. Alf's wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will, for Alf has just found another job. He will soon be working in an office. He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss of money. From now on, he will wear a suit all day and others will call him 'Mr. Bloggs', not 'Alf'. 

==================Lesson 5 The Facts===============================

Editors of newspapers and magazines often go to extrems to provide theri readers woth unimportant facts and statistics. Last year a jouornalist has been instructed by a well-known magazine to write an article on the presodent's palace in a new African republic. When the article arrived, the editor read the first sentence and then refused to publish it. The article began:'Hundreds of steps lead to the high wall which surrounds the president's palace.' The editor at once sent the journalixt a fax instructing hinm to find out theexact number of steps and the height of the wall.
The journalist immediately set out to obtain these important facts, but he took a long time to send them. Meanwhile the editor was getting impatient, for the magazine would soon go to press. He sent the journalist two more taxes, but received no reply. He sent yet another fax informing the journalist that if he did not reply soon he would be fired. When the journalist again failed to reply, the editor reluctantly published the article as it had originally been written. A week later, the editor at last received a fax from the journalist. Not only the poor man been arrested, but he had been sent to the prison as well. However, he had at last been allowed to send a fax in which he informed the editor that he had been arrested while counting the 1,084 steps leading to the fifteen-foot wall which surrounded hte president's palace.

==================Lesson 6 Smash-and-grab=============================

The expensive shops in a famous arcade neat Piccadilly were just opening. At this time of morning, the arcade was almost empty. Mr. Taylor, the owner of a jewellery shop was admiring a new window display. Two of his assistants had been working busily since eight o'clock and had only just finished. Diamond necklaces and rings had been beautifully arranged on a background of black velvet. After gazing at the display for several minutes, Mr. Taylor went back into his shop.

The silence was suddenly broken when a large car, with its headlights on and its horn blaring, roared down the arcade. It came ot a stop outside the jeweller's . One man stayed at the wheel while two others with black stockings over their faces jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bars. While this was going on, Mr. Taylor was upstairs. He and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window. Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade. One of the thieves was stuck by a heavy statue, but he was too busy helping himslef to diamonds to notice any pain. The raid was all over in three minutes, for the men scrambled back into the car and it moved off at a fantastic speed. Just as it was leaving, Mr. Taylor rushed out and ranafter it throwing ashtrays and vases, but it was impossible t ostop the theives. They had got away with thousands of pounds worth of diamonds.

=====================Lesson 7 Multilated ladies=========================

Has it ever happened to you? Have you ever out your trousers in the washing machine ang then remenbered there wsa a large bank note in your back pocket? Weh nyou rescuede your trousers, did you find the note was whiter than white?People who live in Britain needn't despair when they make mistakes like this(and a lot of people do) ! Fortunately for them, the Bank of England has a team called Multilated Ladies which deals with claims from peole who fed their money to a machine ot to their dog. Dongs, it seems , love to chew up money!

A recent case concerns Jane Butlin whose fiance, John, runs a successful furniture business. John had a very good day and put his wallet containing $3,000 into the microeave oven for safekeeping.Then he and Jane want horse-riding. When they got home, Jane cooked the dinner in the microwave oven and without realixing it, cooked her fiance's wallet as well. Imagine their dismay when they found a beautifully-cooked wallet and notes turned to ash! John went out to see his bank manger who sent the remians of wallet and the money to the special department of the Bank of England in Newcastle: the Mutilated Ladies! They examined the remains and John got all his money back. 'So long as there's something to identify we will give people their money back,' said a spokesman for the Bank. 'Last year, we paid $1.5m on 21,000 claims.' 

======================Lesson 8 A famous monastery===================

The Great St. Bernard Pass connects Switzerland to Italy. At 2,473 metres, it is the highest mountain pass in Europe. The famous monastery of St. Bernard, which was founded in the eleventh centruy, lies about a mile away. For hundreds of years, St. Bernard dogs have saved the lives of travellers crossing the dangerous Pass. These friendly dogs, which were first brought from Asia, were used as watchdogs  even in the mountains, the Pass is less dangerous, but each year, the dogs are still sent out into the snow whenever a traveller is in difficulty. Despite the new tunnel, there are still a few people who rashly attempt to cross the Pass on foot.

During the summer months, the monastery is very busy., for it is visited by thousands of people who cross the Pass in cars. As there are so many people about, the dogs have to be kept in a special enclosure. In winter, hwever, life at the monastery is quite different. The tenperature drops to -30° and very few people attempt to cross the Pass. The monks prefer winter to summer for they have more privacy. The dogs have greater freedom, too, for they are allowed to wander outside their enclosure. The only regular visitors to the monastery in winter are parties of skiers who go there at Christmas and Easter. These young people, who loves the peace of the mountains, always receive a warn welcome at St. Bernard's monastery.

=========================Lesson 9 Flying cats==============================
Cats neverv fail to fascinate human beings. They vanb be freindly and affectionate towards humnas, but they lead mysterious lives of their own as well. They never become submissive like dogs and horses. As a result, humans have learned to respect feline independence. Most cats remian suspicous of humans all their lives. One of the things that fasinate ua most about cats is the popular belief that they have nine lives. Apparently, there is a good deal of the truth in this idea. A cat's ability to survive falls is based on that fact.

Recently the New York Animal Medical Centre made a study of 132 cats over a period of five months. All these cats had one experience in common: they had fallen off high buildings, yet only eight of them died from shock and injuries. Of course, New York is the ideal place for such asa interesting study, because there is no shortage of tall buildings.There are plently of high-rise windowsills to fall from! One cat, Sabrina, fell 32 storeys, yet only suffered from a broken tooth. 'Cats behave like well-trained paprptroopers, ' a doctor said. It seems that the further cats fall, the less they are likely to injure themselves. In a long drop, they reach their speeds of 60 miles an hour and more. At high speeds, falling cats have more time to relax. They stretch out their legs like flying squirrels. This increases their air-assistance and reduces the shock of impact when they hit the ground.

===================Lesson 10 The loss of the Titanic =============================
The great trip, Titanic, sailed for New York from Southampton on April 10th, 1912. She was crying 1,316 passengers and a crew of 891. Even by modern standards, the 46,000 ton Titanic was a colossasl ship. At that time, however, she was not only the largest ship that had ever been built, but was regarded as unsinkable, for she had sixteen watertight compartments. Even if two of this greater liner will always be remembered for she went down her first voyage eith heavy loss of life.

Four days after setting out, while the Titanic was sailing across the icy waters of the North Atlantic, a huge iceberg was suddenly spotted by a lookout. After the alarm had been given, the great ship turned sharply to avoid a diraet collision. The Titanic turned just in time, narrowly missing the immerse wall of ice ehich rose over 100 feetout of the water beside her. Suddenly. there ws a slight trembling sound from below, and the caption went down to see what had happened. The noise had been so faint that no one thought that the ship had been damaged. Below, the caption realized to his horror that the Titanic was sinking repidly, fro five of her sixteen watertight compartments had already been flooded! The order to abandon ship was given and hundreds of people plunged into the icy water. As there wasnot enough life boats for everybody, 1,500 lives were lost.

 ================Lesson 11 Not guilty ======================================
Customes Officers are quite tolerant these days, but they can still stop you when you are going through the Green Channel and have nothing to declare. Even really honest people are often made to fell guilty. The hardened professional smuggler, on the other hand, is never troubled by such feelings, even if he has five hundred gold watches hidden in his suitcase. When I returned from aboard recently, a particularly officious young Customs Officer clearly regarded me as a smuggler.

'Have you anything to declare?' he asjed, looking me in the eye.

'No,' I answered confidently.

'Would you mind unlocking this suitcase please?' 

'Not at all,' I answered.

The Officer went through the case with great care. All the things I had packed so carfully were soon in a dreadful mess. I felt sure I would never be able to close the case again. Suddenly, I saw the Officer's face light up. He had spotted a tiny bottle at the bottom of my case and he pounced on it with delight.

'Perfume, eh?' he asked sarcastically. 'You should have declared that. Perfume is not exempt from import duty.'

'But it isn't perfume,' I said. 'It's a hair gel.' Then I added with a smile. 'It's a strange mixture I make myself.'

As I expected, he did not believe me.

'Try it!' Isald encouragingly.

The Officer unscrewed the cap and put the bottle to his nostrils. He was greeted by an unpleasnt smell which convinced him that I was telling the truth. A few minutes later, I was able to hurry away with precious chalk marks on my baggage.

===================Lesson 12 Life on a deserted island=========================

Most of us have found an unrealistic picture of life  on a desert island. We sometimes imagine a desert island to be a sort of paradiese where the sun always shines. Life there is simple and good. Ripe fruit falls from the trees and you never have to work. The otherside of the pidture is quite the opposite. Life on a desert island is wretched. You either starve to death or live like Robinson Crusoe, wating for a boat which never comes. Perhaps there is an element of truth in both these pictures, but few of us have had the opportunity  to find out. 

Two men who recently spent five days on a coral island wished they had stayed there longer. They were taking a badly damaged boat from the Virgin Islands to Miami to have it repaired. During the journey, their baot began to sink. They quickly loaded a small rubber dinghy with food, matches, and cans of beer and rowed for a few miles across the Caribbean until they arrived at a tiny coral island. There were hardly any trees on the island and there was no water, but this did not to be a problem. The men collected rainwater in the rubber dinghy. As they had brought a spear gun with them, they had plenty to eat. They caught lobster and fish everyday, and, as one of them put it 'ate like kings'. When a passing tanker rescued them five days later, both men were genuniely sorry that they ahd to live.

=========================Lesson 13 'It's only me' ===========================

After her husband had gone to work, Mrs. Richards sent her children to school and went upstairs to her bedroom. She was too excited to do any housework that morning, for in the evening she would be going to a fancy-dress party with her husband. She intended to dress up as a ghost and as she had made her costume the night before, she was impatient to try it on. Though the costume consisted only of a sheet, it was very effective. After putting it on, Mrs. Richards went downstairs. She wanted to find out whether it would be comfortable to wear.

Just as Mrs. Richards was entering the dining room, there was a konck on the front floor. She knew that it must be the baker. She had told him to come straight in if ever she failed to open the door and to leave the bread on the kitchen table. Not wanting to frighten the poor man, Mrs. Richards quickly hid in the small storeroom under the stairs. She heard the fornt floor open and heavy footsteps in the hall. Suddenly the door of the storeroom was opened and a man entered. Mrs. Richards realized that it must be the man from the Electricity Board who had come to read the metre. Seh tried to explain the situation, saying 'It's only me', but it was too late. The man let out a cry and jumped back several paces. When Mrs. Richards walked towards him, he fled, slamming the door behind him.

===========================Lesson 14 A noble gangster====================

There was a time when the owners of shops and business in Chicago had pay large sums of money to gangsters in return for 'protection'. If the money was not paid promptly, the gangsters  would quickly put a man out of business by destroying his shop. Obtaining 'protection money' is not a modern crime. As long ago as the fourteenth century, an Englishman, Sir John Hawkwood, made the remarkable discovery that people would rather pay large sums of money than have their life work destroyed by gangsters. 

Six hundreds years ago, Sir John Hawkwood arrived in Italy with a band of soiders and settled near Florence. He soon made a name for himself and came to be known to the Italians as Giovanni Acuto. Whenever the Italian city-states were at war with each other, Hawkwood used to hire his soiders to princes who were willing at pay the high price he demanded. In times of peace, when business was a bad, Hawkwood and his men would march into a city-state and, after burning down a few farms, would offer to go away if protection money was paid to them. Hawkwood made large sums of money in this way. In spite of this, the Italians regarded him as a sort of hero. When he died at the age of eighty, the Florentines gave  him a state funeral annd had a picture painted ehich was dedicated to the memory of  ' the most valinat soldier and most notable leader, Signor Giovanni Haukodue'.

========================Lesson 15 Fifty pence worht of trouble===============

Children always appreciate small gifts of money. Mum or dad, of course, provide a regular supply of pocket pmney, but uncles and aunts are always a suorce of extra income. With some children, small sums go a long way. If fifty pence pieces are not exchanged for sweets, they rattle for months inside money boxes. Only very thriftly children manage to fill up a money box. For most of them, fifty pence is a small price to pay for a nice big jar of chocolate.

My nephew, Geoge, has a money box but it is always empty. Very few of the fifty pence pieces and pound coins I have given him have found their way there. I gave him fifty pounds yesterday and advised him to save it. Instead he bought himself fifty pence worth of trouble. On his way to the sweet shop, he dropped his fifty pence and it bounced along the pavement and then disappeared down a drain. George took off his jacket, rolled up his sleeves and pushed his right arm through the drain cover. He could not find his fifty pence piece anywhere, and what is more, he could not get thruohg his arm out. A crowd of people gathered round him and a lady rubbed his arm with soap and butter, but George was firmly stuck. The fire brigade was called and two fire fighters freed George using a special type of grease. George was not too upset by his experience because the lady who owns the sweet shop heard about his teoubles and rewarded him with a large box of chocolates.

=========================Lesson 16 Mary ahd a little lamb===================

Mary and her husband Dimitri lived ub the tiny village of Perachora in southern Greece. One of Mary's prize was a littel lamb which her husband had given her. She kept it tied to a field during the day and went to fetch it every evening. One evening, however, the lamb was missing. The rope had been cut, so it was obvious that the lamb had been stolen. 

When Dimitri came in from of the fields, his wife told him what had happened. Dimitri at once set out to find the thief. He knew it would not prove difficult in such a small village. After telling several of his friends about the theft, Dimitri immediateky went to Aleko's house and angrily accused him of stealing the lamb. He told him he had beeter return it or he would call the office. Aleko denied taking it and led Dimitri into his backyard. It was true that he had just bought a lamb, he explained, but his lamb was black. Ashamed of having acted so hashly, Dimitri apologized to Aleko for having accused him. While they were talking it began to rain and Dimitri stayed in Aleko's house until the rain stopped. When he went outside half an hour later, he was astonished to find that the littleblack lamb was almost white. Its wool, which had been dyed black, had been washed clean by rain!

===================Lesson  17 the longest suspension bridge in the world===============
Verrazano, an Itaian about whom little is known, sailed intot New York Harbour in 1524 and named it Angouleme. He described it as 'a very agreeable situation located within two small hills in the midst of which flowed a great river.' Though Verrazano is by no means considered to be a great explorer, his name will probably remain immortal, for on November 21st, 1964, the longest suspension bridge in the world was named after him. 

The Verrzano Bridge, which was designed by Othmar Ammann, joins Brooklyn to Staten Island. It has a span of 4,260 feet. The bridge is so long that the shape of the earth had to be taken into account by its designer. Two great towers support four huge cables. The towers are built on immense undeerwater platforms made of steel and concrete. The platforms extend to a depth of over 100 feet under the sea. These alone took sixteen to build. Above the surface of the water, the towers rise to a height of nearly 700 feet. They support the cabels from which the bridge has been suspended. Each of the four cables contains 26,108 lengths of its total capacity. However, size and strengtht are not the only important things about this bridge. Despite its density, it is both simple and elegant, fulfilling its designer's dream to create 'an enormous object draawn as faintly as possible'.
