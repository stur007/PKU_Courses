# Course Resources for a School of Physics, PKU Undergraduate

## Introduction

As a physics undergraduate at PKU, I started to organize my learning resources since 2025 spring, which not only helps me to master what I have learned better, but also provide fellows with access to course materials and avoid some unnecessary difficuties. If you are insterested in this repo, feel free to share with me your ideas!
