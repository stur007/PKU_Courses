  - The **Big Bang Theory** supported by cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) detected by satellites like COBE and WMAP.
  - Observations of the universe's expansion through **redshifted light** (Hubble's Law).
- **Connection to Humans**: Understanding our origins provides context for humanity’s place in the cosmos.

------

### 2. **Are We Alone in the Universe?**

- Evidence:
  - The discovery of **exoplanets** in the habitable zone (e.g., by Kepler and TESS telescopes).
  - Organic molecules found in meteorites and on moons like Titan suggest the possibility of life beyond Earth.
- **Connection to Humans**: Such discoveries could redefine our understanding of life and our significance in the universe.

------

### 3. **How Astronomy Shapes Human Culture and History**

- Evidence:
  - Ancient civilizations like the **Egyptians and Mayans** aligned their architecture and calendars with astronomical events.
  - The role of constellations and celestial phenomena in myths, navigation, and agriculture.
- **Connection to Humans**: Astronomy has influenced human progress, from timekeeping to space exploration.

------

### 4. **The Role of Dark Matter and Dark Energy in the Universe**

- Evidence:
  - Observations of galaxy rotation curves (Vera Rubin’s work) suggest the presence of **dark matter**.
  - Supernova data indicating the accelerated expansion of the universe point to **dark energy**.
- **Connection to Humans**: Understanding these mysterious forces could unlock the future of physics and technology.

------

### 5. **The Importance of Space Exploration for Humanity**

- **Connection to Humans**: Space exploration is essential for ensuring humanity’s long-term survival and advancing scientific knowledge.

------

### 6. **The Universe and the Search for Meaning**

- Evidence:
  - Philosophical reflections from scientists like Carl Sagan and Neil deGrasse Tyson emphasize our small yet significant role in the cosmos.
  - The concept of the **Pale Blue Dot**, showing Earth as a tiny speck in a vast universe, invites reflection on humanity's unity and fragility.
- **Connection to Humans**: Inspires a sense of awe and a drive for collaboration and conservation.

------

### 7. **How Astronomical Events Impact Earth and Human Life**

- Evidence:
  - Solar flares and geomagnetic storms impact satellite systems and power grids.
  - Historical records of comets and supernovae (e.g., Halley’s Comet, SN 1054) influencing human perception.
- **Connection to Humans**: Highlights the practical and philosophical importance of understanding our celestial environment.

## Something that interested in

### Aliens

Fermi's paradox: why we haven't found aliens until now?

**Exoplanets** are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. Since the first discovery of an exoplanet in the 1990s, thousands of them have been found, many in the "habitable zone" (also called the "Goldilocks zone"), where conditions might allow for liquid water, a key ingredient for life as we know it.

water and organic matters on the planet

### Space Travel

first started in 1950, we haven't went to lots of stars till now. the journey to Mars is somehow difficult. 

> Stephen Hawking, renowned British theoretical physicist, said, "I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet. But I'm an optimist. We will reach out to the stars."

SpaceX(private company) and NASA(government) need  to collaborate to finish the mission such as the project of international space station.

### the universe and search for meaning

In 1990, the **Voyager 1 spacecraft** took a famous photograph of Earth from a distance of about 6 billion kilometers, showing our planet as a tiny, pale blue dot against the vastness of space. This image was famously described by **Carl Sagan** in his reflections on human life and its significance.

Anthropic Principle: Small changes in these constants could make the universe inhospitable to life as we know it.

the positron and other anti-particles

the development of universe8787: we are living in one of the bubble of the time and space, so it is possible in theory we can finish this task, although it is difficult to reach this point. 

theory of everything: For centuries, scientists have been piecing together the fundamental forces of the universe (gravity, electromagnetism, weak and strong nuclear forces). A TOE would unify these forces into a single, elegant theory.
